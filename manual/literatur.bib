  abstract = {Current developer tools and HDLs for system design are powerful instruments
    and support a variety of abstraction levels but they are too complex
    for didactic purpose. This paper describes the RTeasy IDE, an algorithmic
    design environment on register transfer level, that has been developed
    to provide a simple system-design tool for didactic purpose. The
    RTeasy tool suite includes an HDL, a simulator and further design
    features. As an example, it is applied to the design flow of a shift-multiplier.},
