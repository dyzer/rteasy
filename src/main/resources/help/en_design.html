<p>
RTeasy offers tools for using an RTeasy model in the design process.
Those currently include the
<a href="#signals">derivation of a possible interface</a>
between
control and operation unit, the
<a href="#mealyfsm">transformation</a>
of the RTeasy model to a
model equivalent to a mealy FSM and the
<a href="#vhdl">export to structural VHDL</a>.
These tools can be found in the "Design" menu.
</p>

<h2><a name="signals"></a>Derivation Of A Possible Interface</h2>
<p>
Currently all unique RT and memory operations receive their own
control signal. For the conditional signals all expressions in
<b>if</b>-statements are treated this way: boolean expressions are
split up into non-boolean ones. All unique non-boolean expressions
get their own conditional signal. This is due to the fact that boolean
expressions are manipulated during the transformation of the RTeasy model
to a mealy FSM.
</p>

<h2><a name="mealyfsm"></a>Transformation To Mealy FSM Model</h2>
<p>
Several constructs of the RTeasy language need state expansion and other
transformations to be realizable into a Mealy FSM. To watch the effect of
those transformations, they could be applied to the model, deriving a model
that could be directly rewritten into a Mealy FSM state chart.
</p>

<h2><a name="vhdl"></a>Transformation To Structural VHDL</h2>
<p>
This tool transforms the functional description on RT level given by
the RTeasy model to a structural RT level description in synthesizable
VHDL. A structural block diagram can be derived using the HDL-to-Graphics
feature of many design tools such as Mentor Graphics' FPGA Advantage.
The generated VHDL may be exported via one huge VHDL file. The generated
code is VHDL-87 and entirely composed using only the synthesizable VHDL
subset accepted by synthesis tools.

<p>
On simulation of the VHDL one should connect a clock signal to the CLK
port of the generated main component. This signal should begin with a
falling edge which is the triggering edge of the control unit.
Also the components are not initialized automatically on start-up as it is
done in RTeasy simulation mode. This is not possible in hardware. Instead
a RESET port is given which should be driven to '1' at least for one clock
cycle. Especially internal memories are sensible to the RESET timing. Their
reset process takes the time from the moment it was triggered until the
same CLK value occurs again, e.g. when started while CLK='0' it lasts until
the falling edge of CLK is triggered. This way it is ensured that the
memory has at least a half-cycle to write '0' to all its cells. Note also
that memory read and write timing is only a half-cycle which clearly limits
the clock frequency when using larger internal memories. In future RTeasy
versions memories might be parameterized by their timing in clock cycles.
